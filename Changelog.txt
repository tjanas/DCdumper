More options:
 -ff -ft : Fake reads to try and kick program out of a rut in the event of read errors (default true)
 -r#     : Retry attempts per pass in event of read errors (min 0, max 20, default 3)
 -sf -st : Step back. Fake reads from end to start after a pass. Perhaps gentler than jumping off a cliff (default true)
 
+Added retry attempts per pass in event of read errors (-r)
+Added fake reads to try and kick program out of a rut in the event of read errors (-f)
